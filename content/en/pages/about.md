I'm currently a cloud engineer with 8 years of experience in game development. Over the years, I've worked on everything from client-side to server-side and backend development, contributing to projects across mobile, VR, and PC platforms.

Beyond game development, I’ve also taken on tasks like building CI/CD pipelines and designing/deploying AWS cloud architectures—basically, a jack-of-all-trades kind of engineer.

Although I’ve moved on from the game industry, my passion for games hasn’t faded one bit. This blog is where I document technical notes related to game development, in hopes that they’ll be helpful to fellow developers who share the same interests.
